Hey! I am Hugo, a professional developer and this is the place where I'll share all my - probably stupid but sometimes helpful - ideas.

In here I will divagate about IT. Probably about current and future projects, frmaeworks, tools, ... I'll also have some kind of "library" in order to keep some helpful pieces of code that can help me and probably someone else... 

Hope you like my ideas, share, find them usefull, whatever...
